# Bikesharing
## Project Overview: 
Using Tableau, I created a set of visualizations to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. The focus of the analysis was on the bike trips duration:
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender by each day of the week.

## Results:
#### 1. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
