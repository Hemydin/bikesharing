## Project Overview: 
The purpose of the project was to analyze bike-sharing data in New York City and use it to prepare the visual analysis for potential investors looking to begin a bike-sharing program in the city of Des Moines, IO. The focus of the analysis was on the bike trips duration:
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender by each day of the week.
